# Contract-Advisor-RAG: : Towards Building A High-Precision Legal Expert LLM APP

#### Business Need

Develop the next-generation contract AI, is the focus of Lizzy AI, an early-stage Israeli startup. To build the first, fully autonomous, artificial contract lawyer, they leverage Hybrid LLM technology (edge, private cloud and LLM services). The first step in the journey is a powerful contract assistant, with the ultimate goal of developing a fully autonomous contract bot, capable of drafting, reviewing, and negotiating contracts, independently, end-to-end, without human assistance.

#### Project Objective

So, My task is as follows: build, evaluate, and improve a RAG system for Contract Q&A (chatting with a contract and asking questions about the contract).
